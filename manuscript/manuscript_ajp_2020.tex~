\begin{abstract}
Synchronization is one of the most diverse fundamental physical phenomena. Synchronization has been studied for over three centuries, from Huygens pendulum clocks to the rhythmic beats of the flapping wings in a flock of birds. It is a goal of physicists to discover synchronization in different forms and learn how to control the phenomenon that occurs when weakly coupled competing oscillators adjust rhythms to match each other. A synchronization phenomenon that the physics community is particularly interested in is dynamic phase locking, which occurs when naturally oscillating motions are driven by an external modulation \cite{juniper}. Another interest of ours is to study the transition from ordered, synchronized dynamics, to disordered, chaotic dynamics. Chaotic dynamics is the irregular, unpredictable time evolution of nonlinear systems and occurs in mechanical oscillators \cite{chaos}. Here, we analyze the microscopic dynamics of phase locking in a colloidal model system using molecular dynamics (MD).

\section{Introduction} % Section titles are automatically converted to all-caps.
% Section numbering is automatic.

\LaTeX\ is typesetting software that is widely used by mathematicians
and physicists because it is so good at typesetting equations. It is 
also completely programmable, so it can be configured to produce 
documents with almost any desired formatting, and to automatically
number equations, figures, endnotes, and so on.

To prepare manuscripts for the American Journal of Physics (AJP), 
you should use the REV\TeX\ 4.1 format for Physical Review B
preprints, as indicated in the \texttt{documentclass} line at the top 
of this article's source file.  (If you're already familiar with 
\LaTeX\ and have used other \LaTeX\ formats, please resist the 
temptation to use them, or to otherwise override REV\TeX's formatting 
conventions, in manuscripts that you prepare for AJP.)

This sample article is intended as a tutorial, template, and reference for 
AJP authors, illustrating most of the \LaTeX\ and REV\TeX\ features that 
authors will need.  For a more comprehensive introduction to \LaTeX, 
numerous books and online references are available.\cite{latexsite, 
wikibook, latexbook}  Documentation for the REV\TeX\ package 
can be found on the APS web site.\cite{revtex}

\LaTeX\ is free software, available for Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
operating systems. For downloading and installation instructions, follow
the links from the \LaTeX\ web site.\cite{latexsite} It is most
convenient\cite{cloudLaTeX} to install a ``complete \TeX\ distribution,'' 
which will include \LaTeX, the underlying \TeX\ engine, macro packages 
such as REV\TeX, a large collection of fonts, and GUI tools for editing 
and viewing your documents.  To test your installation, try to process

\section{Molecular Dynamics Model}

The simulations use overdamped dynamics with Euler's method in a classical two-dimensional model for particles confined to a periodic potential. With only a few particles in two-dimensions, the simulation runs quickly, making this an appropriate model for undergraduates to explore. Particles interact by the Yukawa potential. A single particle has the equation of motion 
\begin{center}
$\eta \vec{v_i} = \vec{F}_{landscape,i} + \sum_{j}^{} \vec{F}_{ij} + \vec{F}_{Drive}(t)$.\\ 
\end{center}
This includes the force of the landscape, inter-particle interactions $\vec{F}_{ij} = - \nabla V(\vec{r}_{ij})$, and a driving force $\vec{F}_{Drive}(t) = [F_{DC} + F_{AC} \sin(\omega t)] \hat{y}$, where $\omega = 2 \pi f$. The landscape is a sine function that is position dependent and calculate the landscape force on the particle directly from its location. The driving force does add energy into the system, and some of it is lost. The damping comes from the viscous fluid providing a nonconservative force.

Overdamped dynamics is a common assumption in models of colloid particles. This is an assumption that the suspending fluid is highly viscous and exerts a damping force on the particles equivalent to a linear drag force $F_{drag} = - \eta v$ and the acceleration of the particle is zero. The equation of motion we include makes both assumptions and is rearranged to reflect that. The equation of motion is not integrated for the velocity, instead it provides a direct calculation of the velocity.  

In this model the Verlet method is equivalent to the Euler method.  Euler's method is then used to calculate the position. Most undergraduate students learn the Euler method in Computational Physics and Differential Equations, but don't encounter the Verlet method. It is a nice opportunity to teach an extension of a method they know. 


\section{MD Simulations}

\subsection{Single particle system}  % In subsection headings, only the first word is capitalized.

We used our model to generate a system, Fig. 1a), where the particle hops between troughs in the energy landscape. In the attached movie, Figure1.mp4, we apply a constant $F_{AC}$ with frequency $f$ then slowly increase $F_{DC}$  to achieve a variety of modes. A mode is a periodic pattern of hops with a constant average particle velocity, $\bar{v}_{y}$ over a range of driving forces $F_{DC}$. In the velocity-force plot in Fig. 1b) $\bar{v}_{y}$ is increasing non-uniformly, with steps, indicating mode locking. A related experiment \cite{juniper} revealed the microscopic dynamics of mode locking by driving colloids across a periodic landscape generated by optical tweezers.

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.25]{single}
\caption{\textbf{(a)} The particle is driven with a constant $F_{AC}$ and $f$ through a periodic potential landscape where blue are minima and red are maxima in the potential. \textbf{(b)} An average particle velocity in the y-direction $\bar{v}_{y}$ as a function of the driving force $F_{DC}$. In the animation the magenta dot represents the $\bar{v}_{y}$ at which the particle in Fig. 1a) is moving.}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Multi-particle system}

We also simulated a twenty particle system confined to a narrow channel, as shown in Fig. 2a). The interparticle forces of neighboring particles cause the system to form a buckled chain when the system is annealed. When a single particle is driven, the neighboring particles act similarly to a periodic landscape to impede its motion. A driven particle can exhibit mode locking with a well-chosen AC drive and frequency. In the attached movie, Figure2.mp4, we show the complex dynamics of mode locking, where the driven particle leap-frogs past the other particles. 

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.40]{twenty}
\caption{\textbf{(a)} The orange particle is driven with a constant $F_{AC}$ and $f$ through 19 particles, colored green, confined by a quasi one-dimensional channel. The landscape is colored as in Fig. 1. \textbf{(b)} $\bar{v}_{y}$ versus $F_{DC}$, where $\bar{v}_{y}$ is the average particle velocity of the driven particle in the y-direction.}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Kinked system}

For a bulleted list, just use \texttt{itemize} instead of \texttt{enumerate}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Across a resistor, $\Delta V = \pm IR$.
\item Across a capacitor, $\Delta V = \pm Q/C$.
\item Across an inductor, $\Delta V = \pm L(dI/dt)$.
\end{itemize}


\section{Quasi-periodic substrate}
\label{DispEqSection}	% You can label sections for reference

When an equation is important and/or tall and/or complicated, you should 
display it on a line by itself, with a number. To do this, you put 
\verb/\begin{equation}/ before the equation and \verb/\end{equation}/ 
after it, as in     % Note: never put a blank line before an equation.
\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty \! \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \, dx = 6\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac1{k^4} = 
    6\left(\frac{\pi^4}{90}\right) = \frac{\pi^4}{15}.
\end{equation}
% Don't put a blank line after the equation unless you're starting a new paragraph.
This example also shows how to make the sum and integral symbols, big parentheses, 
% Don't use \left and \right for small parentheses; you'll get too much space around them.
and built-up fractions.  (Don't put built-up fractions in a 
non-displayed equation, because there won't be enough vertical space in 
AJP's final, single-spaced paragraphs.  Use the slashed form, $x^3/(e^x-1)$, 
instead.)

If you want to refer to an equation elsewhere in your manuscript, you can 
give it a label.  For example, in the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{deriv}
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \mathop{\longrightarrow}_{\Delta t\rightarrow0} \frac{dx}{dt} 
 = \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
we've inserted \verb/\label{deriv}/ to label this equation 
\texttt{deriv}.\cite{labelnames}  To refer to 
Eq.~(\ref{deriv}), we then type \verb/\ref{deriv}/.\cite{footnotes}  Notice 
that AJP's style conventions also require you to put the equation number in 
parentheses when you refer to it, and to abbreviate ``Eq.''\ unless it's at 
the beginning of a sentence.

Some equations require more complicated layouts. In the equation
\begin{equation}
E_n = (n + \tfrac12)\hbar, \quad \textrm{where}\  n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,
\end{equation}
we've used \verb/\quad/ to leave a wide space and \verb/\textrm/ to put ``where'' 
in plain Roman type.  To create a matrix or column vector, as in
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
	t' \\
	x' \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
	 \gamma & -\beta\gamma \\
	-\beta\gamma & \gamma \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	t \\
	x \\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
you can use the \texttt{pmatrix} and/or \texttt{bmatrix} environment, 
for matrices delimited by parentheses and/or brackets.  There's also
a plain \texttt{matrix} environment that omits the delimiters.
In this and other examples of \LaTeX\ tables and arrays, the \verb/&/ 
character serves as a ``tab'' to separate columns, while the \verb/\\/ 
control sequence marks the end of a row.

For a list of related equations, with nicely lined-up equals signs, 
use the \texttt{eqnarray} environment:
\begin{eqnarray}
\oint \vec B \cdot d\vec\ell & = & -\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} ; \\
\oint \vec E \cdot d\vec\ell & = & \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} + \mu_0 I.
\end{eqnarray}
You can also use \texttt{eqnarray} to make a multi-line equation, for example,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{Z} 
& = & 1 + e^{-(\epsilon-\mu)/kT} + e^{-2(\epsilon-\mu)/kT} + \cdots \nonumber \\
& = & 1 + e^{-(\epsilon-\mu)/kT} + (e^{-(\epsilon-\mu)/kT})^2 + \cdots \nonumber \\
& = & \frac{1}{1 - e^{-(\epsilon-\mu)/kT}}.
\end{eqnarray}
Here the first column of the second and third lines is empty.  Note that you 
can use \verb/\nonumber/ within any line to suppress the generation of
an equation number; just be sure that each multi-line equation has at least 
one number.

Another commonly used structure is the \texttt{cases} environment, as in
\begin{equation}
m(T) =
\begin{cases}
	0 & T > T_c \, , \\
	\bigl(1 - [\sinh 2 \beta J]^{-4} \bigr)^{1/8} & T < T_c \, .
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

At AJP we require that you put correct punctuation before and after every
displayed equation, treating each equation as part of a correctly punctuated
English sentence.\cite{mermin} The preceding examples illustrate good
equation punctuation.


\section{Associated problems}

\LaTeX\ can import figures via the \verb/\includegraphics/ macro.
For AJP, you should embed this in the \texttt{figure} environment, which 
can place the figure in various locations.  This environment also lets 
you add a caption (which AJP requires) and an optional label for referring 
to the figure from elsewhere.  See Fig.~\ref{gasbulbdata} for an example.

\begin{figure}[h!]
% The bracketed code determines the figure's placement:  "h" stands for 
% "here", telling LaTeX to put the figure as close to the current location 
% as possible.  The ! overrides LaTeX's tendency to try to find a location 
% that it thinks is better.  But don't agonize over the exact figure placement 
% in your submitted manuscript.  For your initial submission, just make sure 
% each figure is reasonably close to where it's first referenced.
\centering
\includegraphics{GasBulbData.eps}
\caption{Pressure as a function of temperature for a fixed volume of air.  
The three data sets are for three different amounts of air in the container. 
For an ideal gas, the pressure would go to zero at $-273^\circ$C.  (Notice
that this is a vector graphic, so it can be viewed at any scale without
seeing pixels.)}
\label{gasbulbdata}
\end{figure}
% When an AJP manuscript is conditionally accepted for publication, we
% will request an editable copy of the manuscript in which the figures 
% themselves have been removed, and all figure captions have been moved
% to the end.  You should then comment-out the \includegraphics line
% and move the entire \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} block to the end
% of the source file, just before \end{document}.

Most \LaTeX\ implementations can import a variety of graphics formats.
For graphs and line drawings you should use vector (i.e., resolution-independent)
graphics saved in encapsulated PostScript (.eps) or portable document
format (.pdf).  Most good graphics software systems can save to one 
or both of these formats.  Please don't use a rasterized graphics format
(such as .jpg or .png or .tiff) for graphs or line drawings.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ThreeSunsets.jpg}
% Notice the width specification.  Photographs should normally have a
% resolution of approximately 300 pixels per inch when printed, that is,
% a total width of about 1000 pixels for a photo to be printed one column
% wide.  Note also that this included photo is in .jpg format even though 
% a .tiff version should be submitted for final production.
\caption{Three overlaid sequences of photos of the setting sun, taken
near the December solstice (left), September equinox (center), and
June solstice (right), all from the same location at 41$^\circ$ north
latitude. The time interval between images in each sequence is approximately
four minutes.}
\label{sunsets}
\end{figure}

For photographs and other images that are \textit{inherently} made 
of pixels (that is, rasters or bitmaps), \LaTeX\ can 
(usually) handle the .jpg and .png formats as well as .eps and .pdf.  
Figure~\ref{sunsets} is a .jpg example. For final production, however, 
AJP prefers that raster images be in .tiff format.  Most \LaTeX\ systems 
can't import .tiff images, so we recommend using .png or .jpg with \LaTeX\ 
for your initial submission, while saving a higher-quality .tiff version 
to submit as a separate file after your manuscript is conditionally accepted
for publication.

Please refer to the AJP editor's web site\cite{editorsite} for more details 
on AJP's requirements for figure preparation.


\section{Conclusion}

We hope this article will help you prepare beautifully typeset
manuscripts for the American Journal of Physics.  Good typesetting requires
considerable attention to detail, but this effort will pay off by making your
manuscript easier and more enjoyable to read.  Your colleagues, reviewers, 
and editors will be grateful for your effort.

Of course, we encourage you to put as much care into the \textit{content} 
of your manuscript as you put into its form.  The AIP Style 
Manual\cite{AIPstylemanual} is an indispensable reference on good physics 
writing, covering everything from planning and organization to standard 
spellings and abbreviations.

Most important of all, please familiarize yourself with the AJP Statement
of Editorial Policy,\cite{editorsite} which describes the types of manuscripts 
that AJP publishes and the audience for which AJP authors are expected to write.
You wouldn't want to put all that care into preparing a manuscript for AJP,
only to find that AJP is the wrong journal for your manuscript.

We look forward to receiving your submission to AJP.
