The goal of this project is to explore the rudimentary mechanism of synchronization for a single particle moving across a corrugated landscape.  The particle is subject to an applied driving force with controllable magitude and frequency parameters.  The response of the particle to the applied drive depends on the height and spacing of the corrugations.

A detailed description of the physics suitable for publication in AJP

code:

The supplementary codes were written in Python3.  To run these codes, install a Python 3 interpreter.

The programs use common Python packages including numpy and matplotlib.  These come preinstalled in the Anaconda interpreter, but may need to be installed with another interpreter.
